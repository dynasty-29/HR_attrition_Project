Age is stongly correlated with monthly income

We see most of the employees leaving are at 26 to 35 years of age

Monthly income between male and female is highly skewed , however 

Male employees have the highest number of outliers on the upper side compared to females, meaning most of them have high paying job positions compared to females

Managers and executives are paid highest, They also have the least turn over
